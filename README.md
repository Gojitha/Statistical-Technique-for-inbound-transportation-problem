A small factory has two transportation routes: 
       Route-1: Through northern regional hub.
       Route-2: Through from southern regional hub.

When ever an inventory is full in southern regional hub it is transferred to northern regional hub. 
  
When an order is allocated to northern regional hub, the lead time to get the request accepted in northern region hub is higher than southern region hub. 

Are these drivers avoiding as much as possible to the north route ?
